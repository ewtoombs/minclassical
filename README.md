# minclassical
A minimalist streaming client for Toronto's New Classical FM.

### intro

Toronto's New Classical FM is now hosted online at http://www.classicalfm.ca/.  
Run entirely on javascript, this site is an over-engineered ten tonne 
abomination, deserving of total annihilation. This software maker settled for 
redesign, following reverse engineering. This script is the result. Its 
footprint is small enough to allow it to run on resource-limited systems like 
the Raspberry PI or this software maker's 10-year-old laptop, currently being 
used as a media server.

The basic code can be used on other radio stations on zoomermedia.ca, where 
New Classical is hosted.

### dependencies
1. websockets
1. python requests
1. mpv (easily exchangeable with other media players.)
