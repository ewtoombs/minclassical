# minclassical
A minimalist streaming client for Toronto's New Classical FM.

### intro

Toronto's New Classical FM is now hosted online at http://www.classicalfm.ca/.  
Run entirely on javascript, this site is an over-engineered ten tonne 
abomination, deserving of total annihilation. This software maker has settled 
for redesign, following reverse engineering.

Elements of this script can be used to extract streaming URLs for use with 
other standalone media players. The basic code can be used on other radio 
stations on zoomermedia.ca, where New Classical is hosted.
